        Hi There! I'm Louis and I'm a computer science student at the University
        of Wisconsin - Madison. I'm very interested in Web and Financial
        technologies, both of which make up most of my time on the internet. I'm
        always in the process of learning something new and sharing as much of
        it as I can with everyone around me. I enjoy writing software that
        solves practical problems or makes living life a tad bit easier. Other
        than that, I also like dedicating my time to playing Spikeball or
        dabbling with Cryptocurrency.{' '}
